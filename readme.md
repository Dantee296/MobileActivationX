# MobileActivationX
Some C code I wrote to handle the modification of mobileactivationd ⚡️☀️

Today i’m releasing a little bit of prototype code so that users can get started with the process of experimenting with the modification of mobileactivationd.

The code has also been written in pure C to allow for maximum cross-operating system compatibility!

I’ve tried commenting my code a little, but could definitely do with improvements for sure. It also includes an extract of my personal iLibX iDevice interaction library.

I’ve not included any Apple Materials in this code to avoid it being removed!

Enjoy, and do let me know if you have any questions!
